# MeshGeometry
Generating 3D Map of Gale Crater Using Unity3d and C#.
The program generates the crater model during runtime. Each verticesâ€™ coordinates are calculated from a heightmap that is a PNG image and this data gets converted into a 3D model. Then the mesh triangles are calculated and visible surfaces are created.
